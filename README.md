# Fast Quaternion Normalization
The code presents a new completely rational quaternion normalizer together with some comparisons with representatives. It can give accurate results with very computationally efficient and completely rational operations. Try it using any C compilers!

Sample compilation:
```
gcc -o quat_norm quat_norm.c
./quat_norm
```
